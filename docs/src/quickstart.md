# Getting Started

## Minimal Requirements
Every calibration using Ensemble Kalman Inversion requires the following information:
- A forward model that uses parameters to predict output
- Observational data
- Model parameters to calibrate on

## Implementing your experiment

### Forward Model

Your forward model must implement the [`forward_model(iteration, member)`](@ref) 
function stub.

Since this function only takes in the iteration and member numbers, there are some 
hooks to obtain parameters and the output directory:

- [`path_to_ensemble_member`](@ref) returns the ensemble member's output directory, 

which can be used to set the forward model's output directory.
- [`parameter_path`](@ref) returns the ensemble member's parameter file, which can 
be loaded in via TOML or passed to ClimaParams.

### Observational data

Observational data generally consists of a vector of observations with length `d`
 and the covariance matrix of the observational noise with size `d Ã— d`.

If you need to stack or sample from observations, EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl's 
[Observation](https://clima.github.io/EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl/dev/API/Observations/#Observation) 
or [ObservationSeries](https://clima.github.io/EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl/dev/API/Observations/#ObservationSeries) are fully-featured.

An **observation map** to process model output and return the full ensemble's observations is also required.

This is provided by implementing the function stub [`observation_map(iteration)`](@ref). This function needs to return an `Array arr` where `arr[:, i]` will return the i-th ensemble member's observational output.

Here is a readable template for the `observation_map`

```julia
function observation_map(iteration)
    single_observation_dims = 1
    G_ensemble = Array{Float64}(undef, single_observation_dims..., ensemble_size)
    for member in 1:ensemble_size
        G_ensemble[:, member] = process_member_data(iteration, member)
    end
    return G_ensemble
end
```
### Parameters

Every parameter that is being calibrated requires a prior distribution to sample from.

EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl's [constrained_gaussian](https://clima.github.io/EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl/dev/API/ParameterDistributions/#EnsembleKalmanProcesses.ParameterDistributions.constrained_gaussian) 
provides a user-friendly way to constructor Gaussian distributions.

Multiple distributions can be combined using `combine_distributions(vec_of_distributions)`.

For more information, see the EKP documentation for [prior distributions](https://clima.github.io/EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl/dev/parameter_distributions/).

### Experiment Configuration
A calibration consisting of `m` ensemble members will run for `n` iterations.

A good rule of thumb is an ensemble size 10 times the number of parameters.

### Calibrate

Now all of the pieces should be in place:
- forward map
- observation map
- observations
- covariance matrix of the observations (noise)
- prior distribution
- ensemble size
- number of iterations

And we can put it all together:

`calibrate(ensemble_size, n_iterations, observations, noise, prior, output_dir)`

# Example Calibration

A good way to get started is to run the example experiment, `surface_fluxes_perfect_model`, 
which uses the [SurfaceFluxes.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/SurfaceFluxes.jl) package 
to generate a physical model that calculates the Monin Obukhov turbulent surface 
fluxes based on idealized atmospheric and surface conditions. Since this is a "perfect 
model" example, the same model is used to generate synthetic observations using its 
default parameters and a small amount of noise. These synthetic observations are 
considered to be the ground truth, which is used to assess the model ensembles' 
performance when parameters are drawn from the prior parameter distributions. 

It is a perfect-model calibration, using its own output as observational data. 
By default, it runs 20 ensemble members for 6 iterations. 
This example can be run on the most common backend, the WorkerBackend, with the following script:

```julia
using ClimaCalibrate

include(joinpath(pkgdir(ClimaCalibrate), "experiments", "surface_fluxes_perfect_model", "utils.jl"))
@show ensemble_size n_iterations observation variance prior

eki = calibrate(
    ensemble_size,
    n_iterations,
    observation,
    variance,
    prior,
    output_dir,
)

theta_star_vec =
    (; coefficient_a_m_businger = 4.7, coefficient_a_h_businger = 4.7)

convergence_plot(
    eki,
    prior,
    theta_star_vec,
    ["coefficient_a_m_businger", "coefficient_a_h_businger"],
)

g_vs_iter_plot(eki)
```
