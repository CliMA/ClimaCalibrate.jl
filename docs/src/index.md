# ClimaCalibrate.jl

ClimaCalibrate provides a scalable framework for calibrating forward models models using 
the Ensemble Kalman Process (EKP). It integrates with [EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl/) 
to enable distributed model calibration with minimal boilerplate code.

Key Features

- Distributed computing support for multiple HPC environments
- Integration with EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl for parameter estimation
- Flexible model interface for different component models
- Support for emulation and sampling workflows
